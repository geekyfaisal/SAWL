Sawl Serilog.AzureBlobStorage Wrapper (NuGet Package)
Overview
The Sawl (Serilog Azure Blob Storage Wrapper) NuGet package provides a convenient and streamlined implementation for integrating Serilog with Azure Blob Storage. This package acts as a wrapper around the Serilog.AzureBlobStorage sink, making the configuration and usage even more seamless and easy.

Features
Simplified Configuration: The Sawl package simplifies the configuration process for Serilog.AzureBlobStorage, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required to set up logging to Azure Blob Storage.

Default Settings for Convenience: Sawl comes with sensible default settings, allowing you to get started quickly with minimal configuration. Of course, you can still customize the configuration based on your specific needs.

Enhanced Error Handling: Sawl includes enhanced error handling mechanisms, providing clearer error messages and diagnostics in case of configuration issues or problems with the Azure Blob Storage connection.

Getting Started
Installation
Install the Sawl NuGet package along with the underlying Serilog.AzureBlobStorage package:

bash
Copy code
Install-Package Sawl
Or using the .NET CLI:

bash
Copy code
dotnet add package Sawl
Configuration
Configure the Azure Blob Storage sink using the Sawl wrapper in your Serilog configuration:

csharp
Copy code
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.SawlAzureBlobStorage("<your-connection-string>", "<your-container-name>")
    .CreateLogger();
Replace <your-connection-string> with your Azure Storage account connection string and <your-container-name> with the desired container name.

Example
Here's an example of logging a message using Serilog with Sawl Azure Blob Storage wrapper:

Copy code
Log.Information("Hello, Azure Blob Storage with Sawl!");
